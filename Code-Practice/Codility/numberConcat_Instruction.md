Write a function that, given an array of non-negative

integers, concatenates all the numbers in the array into one

number, and prints the smallest number among all the

generated numbers.



Example 1:

Input: \[10,2]

Output: "102"

Example 2:

Input: \[3,30,34,5,9]

Output: "3033459"



Notes:

0 < the length of the input array <= 100, return an empty

string regarding invalid input.



*Illustrate:*

*The output result can be very large, so you need to return a*

*string instead of an integer.*

*The concatenated numbers may have leading Os, and the*

*final result does not need to remove the leading 0s.*
